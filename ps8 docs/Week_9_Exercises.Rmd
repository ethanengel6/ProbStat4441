## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
minority <- c(487, 544, 567, 500, 458, 531, 493, 388, 518, 495, 
              466, 471, 455, 562, 395, 576, 450, 502, 512, 538)

non.minority <- c(592, 649, 515, 536, 621, 483, 534, 577, 600, 553, 
                  529, 714, 484, 636, 595, 660, 530, 598, 497, 597)

(mean.minority <- mean(minority))
#mean = 483, sd = 50
pop_mean_min <- 483
pop_sd_min <- 50

(mean.non.min <- mean(non.minority))
#mean = 553 sd = 50
pop_mean_non <-553
pop_sd_non <-50

(z_val.min <- (mean.minority-pop_mean_min)/(pop_sd_min))

(z_val.non <- (mean.non.min-pop_mean_non)/(pop_sd_non))

# From Neba:  We should have calculated the difference between the means of the 2 groups as our z-statistic

#2 T-Test output
t.test(minority, non.minority)


# draw 1000 samples of length x and calculate the mean, use the samples as the distribution.  See if the population difference is within this confidence interval.  You are using the diff between 2 populations is 0.  You need to check that confidence interval includes 0.

library(boot)
#bootstrapping instructions from Neba

n1 <- length(minority)
n2 <- length(non.minority)

# Draw 5000 bootstrap samples stratified by household type. 
iter = 1000
mean.diff <- rep(NA, iter)
for (i in 1:iter) {
  minority.samp <- sample(minority, n1, replace = T)
  non.min.samp <- sample(non.minority, n2, replace = T)
  mean.diff[i] <- mean(minority.samp)-mean(non.min.samp)
}


hist(mean.diff)




# Look at quantiles of the mean difference

quantile(mean.diff,c(.025,.975))




```

Null hypothesis:  There is no statistically significant difference between the mean SAT scores of the minority and non minority students.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
